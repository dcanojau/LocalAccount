Manage Local Users and Groups on Workstations with PowerShell

This was just a little thought I had put together for supplementing the one thing STILL missing in Windows 10 which is the ability for Windows PowerShell to Manage local Users and Groups

The structure of the module is pretty simple, for the most part it just wraps PowerShell code around the [ADSI[ Accelerator to make it more user friendly.

The Cmdlets have been with the assumption you are going to target Local or remote workstations.   There are some improvements I'd love to see in it but here you go.  Placed on Github to share and allow others to improve.

See?  Even an IT Pro can check in code with Github! :)
